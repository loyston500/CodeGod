# CodeGod
A Powerful Discord bot created for geeks to run codes of multiple languages, smart enough to sense the presence of codeblocks from a message and execute the code inside it.

## How to use?

All you have to do is to write a message with atleast one codeblock, with language specified of course, and then react it with "â–¶" (default) or with the custom emoji (one you have set already, perhaps).

BOOM, your code will be compiled/executed asap.

## How to set a custom emoji? [SERVER ADMIN ONLY]

To set a custom emoji run `cg.setemoji`, and then react it's message with the emoji you want to use. Done.
